  MANUAL NOTES:

        1) The ELEC example on page 7 has the size 233.5 when
           stored in a variable, and size 225 as a list on the stack.

	2) The strings EDITKEY, VIEWKEY, and FINDKEY may be supplied
	   as menu label objects to the Data Browser.  They will
	   present the labels EDIT, VIEW, and FIND, and the edit,
	   view, and alpha-search operations will be bound to the
	   respective menu key.  This allows a menu key to be labeled
	   "EDIT" and perform the same function as the left-shift
	   [EDIT] hard key.
