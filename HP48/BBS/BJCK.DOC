I am on the HP BBS (1-503-750-4448) as icefalcon if you have any questions or
comments.


                              Introduction

When you show your HP-48 to some awed and impressed Casio user, the utility
programs are really impressive only if the guy knowshow hard it should normally
be to do what your HP-48 does effortlessly.  In addition, everyone gets the
urge now and then to do something other than manipulate equations...
And that's where all those slick HP-48 graphics demos come from.
Unfortunately, there don't seem to be that many games, except those for the
HP-28, and those certainly don't stress your HP-48's capabilites.  Maybe
because writing a good game is so time-consuming...


                              BlackJack 48

We wrote a howitzer battle, Defender, and Tetris for the HP-28, but this is our
first release for the HP-48.  It's a simple card game, BlackJack 48.  It uses
the full graphics capabilities of the HP-48, including background pictures...
We spent quite a bit of time on graphics and getting it to look professional.
This is took a while to write, which is why we have the:

                      
                             Shareware Fee

This game is shareware.  You do not have to pay to download it from someone or
somewhere and take a look at it and play it for a while.  However, if you do
decide to keep the program, you need to send your name, address, and $5 to:

   Ron Dippold c/o Freezesoft
   8318 Counterpane Lane
   Juneau, Alaska 99801

This is the same as buying a program in the store except you get to "test
drive" it first.  And it is just as illegal to keep a copy without paying for
it as it is to copy commercial software from someone else.  We suggest you try
it out for a few days to a week, and if you don't like it, wipe it out.  If
you like it and decide to keep it in your calculator or back it up to your PC,
send the registration fee.

We expect to be releasing many more software titles for the HP-48 in the
future, and in many cases we will stipulate that paying for any of them will
constitute valid payment on the rest, so you also buying into future software.
For instance, we plan to introduce poker fairly soon, and this will be covered
by the blackjack fee.  How much new software we produce depends on the
response.

                              The Instructions!

In case you do not know how to play BlackJack, or if you have forgotten, which
is more likely, here is a rehash of the rules, as BlackJack 48 uses them:

  *  A standard 52-card deck of cards is used.  More can be used, but one is
     typical.
  *  The goal is to get as close to 21 as you can without going over it.
  *  Cards 2 thru T (10) are worth their own value.  Jack, Queens, and Kings
     are worth 10 points.
  *  Aces are worth either one point OR eleven points, your choice.

  *  The player (you) places a bet.
  *  Two cards are dealt to you face up.  Two cards are dealt to the
     dealer, one face up.

  *  If the dealer has a "BlackJack," which is an Ace and any card worth 10
     points, the dealer _immediately_ wins.
  *  If you have a"BlackJack, you win, and also win 50% more of your
     bet as a bonus, so a $20 dollar bet would win $30 on BlackJack.
  *  If the dealer _and_ the player have a BlackJack, it it a tie, or a "push"
     and you get your bet back.

  *  You then have the following options:
     - Hit :    Get another card from the deck.  If your card total exceeds 21,
                you have "Busted," and you lose.  You can Hit as many times as
                you want.
     - Stand :  Stay with your cards
     - Double : Double your bet and get ONLY one more card.  If your card total
                exceeds 21, you have Busted, and you lose your doubled bet.

  *  If you Stand or Double (and haven't exceeded 21), the dealer then gets to
     hit or stand.  The rules are _very_ simple for the dealer:
     - If his cards total less than 17, he _has_ to hit.
     - If his cards total 17 or more, he _has_ to stand.
  *  If the dealer exceeds 21, he has Busted, and you win.

  *  If he stands at less than 21, it is then a simple matter of who has the
     highest total.  If you have more points, you win.  If he has more points
     then you win.  If you both have the same, it is a Push, and no one wins.


                                Variations

There are many variations of BlackJack.  Some casinos use 6 decks.  Some only
allow Doubling on the first two cards.  Some say the dealer does not have to
stand on 17 if one of his cards is an Ace.  There is a variation in which you
win if you get 5 cards without going over 21.  We have just implemented a
fairly standard version.  There are two things in particular that need
explaining:

  *  Some casinos offer "Insurance," if the dealer is showing an Ace.  You pay
     an extra amount of cash, and if the dealer does have a BlackJack, you
     don't lose.  It sounds good, but in reality it is just another ploy by
     the casinos to soak you of more money.  Odds are you are going to lose
     more money on the insurance than you will save when the dealer actually
     does have BlackJack.

  *  Another variation states that if your two bottom cards are the same, such
     as an eight of spades and eight of diamonds, you may split your hand into
     two hands.  A card is dealt out to each of the hands so that they each
     have two cards.  Your bet is the same for both hands, so you have
     effectively doubled your bet.  Each hand is played separately.  This is
     not implemented, because we don't really have the room to show both hands.
     If one of the split hands is a pair, you can split again, and the screen
     is only SO big!


                             Running BlackJack 48

After you transfer the BJCK directory to your HP, choose VAR and hit BJCK to
get you into the BlackJack 48 directory.  The first two programs in the
directory, called ABOUT and PLAY are the only ones you need to know about.
All the rest are called by these two programs.

    ABOUT  Run this to see a little title screen for the game and run the game.

    PLAY   After you are sick of the ABOUT screen, you can just run PLAY to
           go straight to the game.



                                Betting

The first screen/menu you will see is a nice background and some information.
The top box should say "You have: $1000" or whatever your current total is.
You will be asked to place your bet.

The bottom box contains the current amount of your bet.  Use the keys labeled
-10, +10, -50, and +50 to add or subtract 10 or 50 dollars from your bet.
Choose the key labeled BET to play the hand.

   *   The maximum bet is $500
   *   You can't bet more than you have.



                                Playing

Two cards are dealt to you and two cards to the dealer.  One of his cards will
be face down.  If you or he has a BlackJack, the hand is over.  Otherwise you
have the following choices:

   HIT:       Get another card.  If you go over 21 you lose.
   DBL:       Double your bet and get only one more card.  If you go over 21
              you lose.
   STAND:     Stand with the cards you have.  It is the dealer's turn.

The dealer will then hit or stand.  If he goes over 21, you win.  Otherwise,
whoever has the highest card total wins.


                               OK / QUIT

Once you have won or lost a hand, you will get an OK / QUIT menu.  If you
choose QUIT, you will be shown your final total and the game is ended.  If you
choose OK, you will be returned to the betting menu except for two special
occasions:
  
  *  If you have no money left, the game is over.
  *  If you have $10,000, you have broken the bank, and you win.  Game over!



                            Technical Info

This program sets some flags and system variables.  It turns off the clock, so
it doesn't show up in the upper right corner over the picture.  It sets the
screen dimensions to 131 * 64 (one full screen).  It also uses many user flags.

It saves all flags when it first runs, and it restores them when it quits.  It
leaves the picture size at 131 * 64.
