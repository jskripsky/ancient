  Subj: puzzle-24 game for HP-48SX
  Date: Fri Sep 28 1990 07:55 

Here's a game I wrote (for hp-48sx) a couple of weeks ago but couldn't send
till now.  Its the puzzle-24 game.  I read that someone wrote
a similar program using the chip8 interpreter.  I thought I'd send this
anyway, it's rather hacked out and it's got a bug, but its still quite
playable.

The problem is that it creates a random layout of the pieces and this 
doesn't always result in a puzzle which can be solved.  About every second
puzzle is solvable.  I wonder if the guy that wrote puzzle-15 knows of
a test to see if the puzzle has a solution, or is the only way to do it
scrambling a completed puzzle.  The program RARR creates an array of
the number 1 to 24 in a random order, this is then used to place the
pieces on the board.  I wonder if some sort of test can be performed on 
this to see if the puzzle will have a solution.  I thought maybe taking
the dot product with [1 2 ... 24 ] and testing if even, but this is not
correct.

Load the directory PUZZLE, go into the the directory's CST menu, then
to play run PLAY and use the arrow keys to move a piece adjacent to the 
empty square into that square.  Due to extreme lazyness on my behalf 
you need to use key y^x as the down arrow ; i.e.

                  ^
               <     >
                 y^x

  Subj: puzzle-24 for HP48-SX
  Date: Sat Sep 29 1990 11:13 

With regard to the solvability of the puzzle-24 game, I seem to
remember from my number-theory days (about 12 years ago now... sigh)
that the puzzle will be solvable precisely when you have written
the numbers down as an - even - permutation of the sequence
1..24 (or n, if you like).  This is because the smallest exchange
you can make with the puzzle is a three-cycle.

By "even permutation" I mean a permutation that can be written
as a product of three-cycles, and by "three-cycle" I mean a 
permutation of the sort (1,2,3) -> (2,3,1).  These are called even
because every permutation can be written as a product of simple 
exchanges, and every three-cycle needs 2 exchanges.  For example,
the above permutation is the product of 1<=>2 and 2<=>3.  It turns out that
exactly half of all permutations are even, so your observation
that half your games are solvable sounds spot-on.

I seem to recall that the inventor of the 15-puzzle (he was
famous for puzzles) made a big splash by offering a big prize
for solving a particular puzzle - which, as he well knew, was
in the impossible half.

I don't remember if there is a simple test for evenness of
a permutation.  It ought to be easy to write an "even" permutatation
generator, though.  Just start with the ordered set and perform 
random three-cycles on it.  This is equivalent to starting with 
your puzzle solved, I guess.
