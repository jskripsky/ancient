                       Compressing Library

     This library (1263) will compress objects with the same
Redundancy Fighter posted earlier.  This library contains four
new functions:  ->COM, COM->, COMPALL, and UNCOMPALL.

->COM will take any argument.  It will compress the object with
the RFP and put the appropriate extension after the compressed
string.  A program or machine code will get RFU EVAL any other
object type will get RFU.  If flag 60 is set the RFU will be the
global name 'RFU' not the XLIB name.  This function will allow
any compressed object to run just like the original.

COM-> requires a program.  It will un-compress a compressed
object.  It checks to see if the first object in the program has
"RF" as its first characters and if it does it RFU's it.

COMPALL requires a list of global names.  The global names are
all ->COMed and then you are asked if you want to restore the
directory order.  If the order is nor important (saves time)
press any key but [ENTER].

UNCOMPALL requires a list of global names.  The global names are
all COM->ed.  You are also asked to restore the directory order.

     RFU and RFP are the same teriffic programs posted several
months back by Lutz Vieweg.  This program does not much more than
automatically check the object type to put on the appropriate program
extension.  But, it is easier to use.

     I express no warranty for the programs posted here.  Always
backup your calculator before using them.
