[Note: The ROBORUN file is the whole directory.  Its source code is so
huge, however, that I broke it up into two pieces, ROBORUN.SRC and
ROBORUN2.SRC, the latter being just the GROBs required.  Although you
will not need to download the source code, you can do so by first
downloading ROBORUN.SRC, entering that directory, and then downloading
ROBORUN2.SRC.  -jkh-]

Attached to this file is Roborun 2.0, a very new version of Roborun 1.1. 
The graphics and music are improved, and I have added a very fun BONUS
ROUND that you play after completing every third round.  While
instructions are included in the program, here are some important points:

- After clearing level 3, 6, 9, etc., you will see a "Bonus Round" box
and will hear Joplin's "Entertainer."

- Then you will see your 3-way laser.  Press any key to start each of 10
stages.

- After pressing any key, you will hear a low tone, followed by pictures
of three robots in the left, middle, and right thirds of the screen.

- Press [7] to fire the left gun, [8] to fire the middle gun, and [9] to
fire the right laser.

- Points are awarded if you hit the target robot (the one shown in
roborun's intro screen, and if you avoid destroying the decoy robots (in
the instructions).

- You are given an exponetially decreasing amount of time to key in your
responses, so be quick and accurate.

- When your time to key in responses is up, the program will emit a high
tone and will lock out any further shots.

- This game is shareware!  Please send $5 to David Liu, 1345 Iverson
Place, Riverside, CA 92506.  Enjoy!

[Note: The High Score roster defaults are outrageously high scores by the
game's author.  You may wish to edit HS (High Scores) and HSN
(High Score Names) to make the game more friendly to beginners!  -jkh-]
