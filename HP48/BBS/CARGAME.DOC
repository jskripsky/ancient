Hi and welcome to a new interesting game for the Hewlett Packard
calculator HP48SX.

This game is called HIGHWAYRACE and the goal is to stear your Ferrari
sportscar on the wrong side of a three lane highway (a piece of
cake!!). The game doesn't need a lot of explaining and the only
things you need to know is: 1) start the game by pressing the INTRO
key. 2) you stear the car up and down on the lanes using the cursor
up & down keys on the HP48 keyboard.

If you've got any suggestions, please feel free to write a letter to:

or write a letter to me on AROS TCL Tel. +46-21-353442.
